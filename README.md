# The Comet Programming Language

This is mostly built for fun and a way of taking things apart to see how they work.  It is based on the interpreter from [Crafting Interpreters](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters)

After programming for a while, there are specific things about the dynamic languages that I've
used that really annoy me, so I'm making my own language to improve some of those.  No doubt I will add things that are annoying.

It takes inspiration from the languages I've used most heavily:

- C
- JavaScript
- Ruby
- Python
- C#

I don't have a firm idea of the syntax or semantics yet - I will be making those up as I go along.  I'd like to think that I'll document it, but it will likely be half-assed, and incomplete.  Have fun!
